#1dv610 - Laboration3

Status:
Based on https://github.com/dntoll/1dv610/blob/master/assignments/A2_resources/TestCases.md I have implented following things
* All testcases in 1.
* All testcases in 2.
* All testcases in 3 except 3.4, 3.5, 3.7 and 3.8
* All testcases in 4 except 4.9, 4.10 and 4.11

* An extra thing that I added as an extra function is a countdown. If you are logged in a button appears and if you click on the button a countdown to the weekend shows. It says wether it's a weekend (Friday after 17 pm to  Sunday) or not. And if it's not a weekend, it shows how many days, hours, minutes and seconds that's left.
